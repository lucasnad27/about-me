Lucas works with the Last Mile program; helping inmates learn valuable skills that can be utilized once released. Before covid hit, he volunteered by visiting San Quentin Prison ~1 time per month to help inmates learn web development skills, with the goal of helping to reduce recidivism and bring diversity to tech. During the pandemic, he has been able to give guidance to recent graduates of the Last Mile Program, preparing them for a successful career in tech.
