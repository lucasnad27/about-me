I work with the Last Mile program; helping inmates learn valuable skills that can be utilized once released. Before Covid, I visited San Quentin Prison to help inmates learn web development skills, with the goal of helping to **reduce recidivism and bring diversity to tech**. During the pandemic, I was able to give guidance to recent graduates of the Last Mile Program, preparing them for a successful career in tech.
