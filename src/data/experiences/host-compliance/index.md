I helped to build the leading compliance platform for short-term rentals, **enabling cities around the country to enforce their STR ordinances**. My team built out a vast network of crawlers, ML models, hotline IVR, highly configurable registration flows, letters, and plenty of behind-the-scenes infrastructure work to keep it all running as the company grew in size and scope.
