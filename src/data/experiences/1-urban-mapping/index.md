I served a multi-faceted role as Operations Engineer; handling special one-off projects to full software-development lifecycle projects; most notably, their flagship product, "Mapfluence", which provides high-value geographic data, accessible through a REST-ful API. My primary responsibilities included developing best practices around managing data within a cloud environment, creating repeatable ETL procedures to leverage a vast data catalog, and assisting the business development team in creating web-based tools.
