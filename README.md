## üìù Context

This site is built using the gatsby static site generator. It's great for a host of frontend applications, but I'm using it as a way to publish work for my professional site. The main features of gatsby that are important in the context of this site:

1. Out-of-the-box starter kits
2. Multiple deployment options with varying levels of integration
3. Open-ended platform. Gatsby isn't "just a way to publish your blog"

I began with the starter designed by [SaimirKapaj](https://github.com/SaimirKapaj/gatsby-markdown-personal-website). As with any javascript project that hasn't been touched in a couple months, multiple dependencies were broken. This isn't uncommon with many emerging language ecosystem. It still frustrates me that the javascript ecosystem hasn't stabilized in this way. I created a brand new gatsby template and slowly added Saimir's work, upgrading libraries to their most recent version, fixing any "broken" code along the way. After a few hours of futzing about, we end up with a frontend stack that includes markdown, [react](https://reactjs.org), [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com), [styled-components](https://styled-components.com), and [framer motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/).

I plan on adding more gatsby plugins as needed to this starter.

## üöÄ Quick start

```
npm install
npm run develop # to run a local version of the software
npm run build # to create a production build artifact
```

## Deploying to netlify

While you can deploy gatsby sites however you wish, I'm using with netlify for it's easy setup, and Github Integration. I'll update the README as needed to remind future me on how I'm getting this site out to the world wide web.
